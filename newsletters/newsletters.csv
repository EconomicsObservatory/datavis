2025-04-05,Liberation Day,The new realities of global trade. The first installment of our re-launched newsletter. ,"Tariffs are taxes on trade, and they are back in fashion.

","This week we look in depth at the deficit that has driven America’s recent market-shaking policies. Tariffs are on pause for 90 days, except for China, and it is unclear what might come next.

2025-05-16,A tough spring,"This week we look at jobs and pay. Big policy changes—to taxation, and to minimum wages—were put in place in April. It could be a tough spring for young workers. ","What are the most important measures in an economy? Is it imports and exports? With all the recent trade talk—including our newsletters on Liberation Day and Britain’s Steel crisis—you might think so. Perhaps it is investment or R&D spending? These things certainly matter, but they don’t matter the most.
